# SICP exercises done (not yet) in Scheme, Haskell and JavaScript

> SICP was firmly optimistic about what a college freshman can be expected to accomplish. SICP students write interpreters for programming languages, ordinarily considered more appropriate for juniors or seniors. The text itself isn't easy reading; it has none of the sidebars and colored boxes and interesting pictures that typify the modern textbook aimed at students with low attention spans. There are no redundant exercises; each exercise teaches an important new idea. It uses big words. But it repays a close reading; every sentence matters.
